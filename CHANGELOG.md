## [1.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc.1)

#### Features

* Makes data sources open.
* Adaptations for RxSwift 3.0.0-rc.1

## [1.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.2)

#### Features

* Adaptations for Swift 3.0

## [1.0.0.beta.1](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources/releases/tag/1.0.0.beta.1)

#### Features

* Adaptations for Swift 3.0

#### Fixes

* Fixes `moveItem`

## [0.9](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources/releases/tag/0.8.1)

#### Possibly breaking changes

* Adds default IdentifiableType extensions for:
	* String
	* Int
	* Float

This can break your code if you've implemented those extensions locally. This can be easily solved by just removing local extensions.

#### Features

* Swift 2.3 compatible
* Improves mutability checkes. If data source is being mutated after binding, warning assert is triggered.
* Deprecates `cellFactory` in favor of `configureCell`.
* Improves runtime checks in DEBUG mode for correct `SectionModelType.init` implementation.

#### Fixes

* Fixes default value for `canEditRowAtIndexPath` and sets it to `false`.
* Changes DEBUG asserting behavior in case multiple items with same identity are found to printing warning message to terminal. Fallbacks as before to `reloadData`.

#### Anomalies

* Fixes problem with `SectionModel.init`.

## [0.8](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources/releases/tag/0.8)

* Fixes old `AnimatableSectionModel` definition.
* Fixes problem with `UICollectionView` iOS 9 reordering features.

## [0.7](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxDataSources/releases/tag/0.7)
